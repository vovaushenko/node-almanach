1. In the next section I use sinon.sandbox.create() but it has been depreciated, please use sinon.createSandbox() instead, everything else remains the same.

2. If you are using mongoose 5.6+, please update the app.js / other places you use mongoose.connect() and wrap in the following if check:

if(mongoose.connection.readyState == 0){
    mongoose.connect(db());
}
The new mongoose throws an error if there is already a connection, this will update the app to only connect if you are not already connected.
